' This one simply update dates in the MS Word title and also the file
    ' I will need following 3:
        ' Applicable Word file Location and Name
        ' Updated date from ITEMin file
    
' Open the ITEMin Excel file to fetch the updated Date
Set objExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
Set objWorkbook = objExcel.Workbooks.Open _
("C:\Users\ekim\Desktop\Projects\hello\ITEMin000.xlsx")

MsgBox "ok wtf"
new_filedate = Trim(objExcel.Cells(2, 10).Value) ' I think we can just get from the first record
customerdata_form = Trim(objExcel.Cells(2, 24).Value)


new_formname = customerdata_form + new_file_date

'Below is the location/file_left of the file to be updated
